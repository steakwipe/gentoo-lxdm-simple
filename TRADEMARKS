The Gentoo Linux logo used because I love Gentoo. I don't own Gentoo, the Gentoo logo, or any Gentoo Foundation trademarks or symbols found herein. The Gentoo Foundation does because they're awesome and have a cool logo to go with their cool Linux. :D <3 

I do however own the "steakwipe" name and any associated logos or graphics thereof. Please don't pretend to be me, unless its funny. To me. If it's not funny, you will be notified and must cease all impersonation of me (steakwipe) immediately, or at least like, within a couple minutes. Be reasonable.
